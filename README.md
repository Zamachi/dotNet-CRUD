# Description

This is a project I've done for a university course; the idea was to make a simple CRUD app, with minimal frontend capabilities, using C# .NET and Postgres SQL database.

# Tools used

1. Visual Studio IDE Community Edition
2. DotNET SDK 5.0
3. Postgres database
4. Entity Framework
5. NuGet packages:
    1. AutoMapper
    2. Dapper
    3. DapperSimpleCRUD
    4. Npgsql

# How to use
Have the necessary tools installed, run the .sln file, open the terminal(make sure you're in the NSI6.Web folder) and type ``dotnet watch run``.
